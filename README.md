> :warning: **DO NOT VISIT ANY OF THE DOMAINS IN THIS BLOCKLIST UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING.** :warning:

All credit goes to the Amnesty International team. I do not intend to profit or steal the limelight from this and have only done this out of goodwill for the community.

## How to use this blocklist

You can feel free to add this to your blocking software like Pi-Hole or otherwise. You should only do so if you know what you are doing, and if you can undo potential damage involved. I am not responsible for any damage that you cause by misimplemnting this blocklist. I am also not responsible for any damage that you cause by visiting any of the domains in the blocklist.

 **Future Updates**

 I do not anticipate updating this list in the future, unless a substantial update is released by the Amnesty International team. Treat this list as-is. Hopefully it will be incorporated into bigger blocklists in the future. Please add issues on the original Reddit post, under the issues tab in the Github web GUI, or via a pull request.
